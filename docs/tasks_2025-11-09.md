# Tasks for 2025-11-09

- [ ] **Stabilize auth flow** – audit `src/models/auth.rs` and `src/services/user_service.rs` so login/registration share common validation, return typed errors, and hash passwords before persistence.
- [ ] **Finish repository wiring** – complete the `UserRepository` and related `traits` implementations so services no longer depend on mock data and can read/write through a single interface.
- [ ] **Task model coverage** – expand `src/models/task.rs` with status enums, timestamps, and serde support, then surface them through the service layer.
- [ ] **End-to-end tests** – add happy-path and failure tests for user + task flows (ideally using `cargo test` with in-memory repos) to lock down regressions before exposing APIs.
- [ ] **Configuration pass** – document the required `.env` keys and add config loading/validation at startup so the binary fails fast when secrets are missing.
- [ ] **API documentation** – draft a concise README section (or `docs/api.md`) that lists the user/task endpoints, request/response bodies, and auth requirements.
